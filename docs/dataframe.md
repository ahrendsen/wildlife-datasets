Each dataset is represented by a pandas dataframe. Each row corresponds to one entry, which depicts one individual animal. Usually one entry corresponds to one image and one animal. However, sometimes, there are multiple animals in an image and then one image may generate multiple entries differentiated by additional information such as bounding box. Columns are descriptions of the entry.


## Required columns

The following three columns must be part of all dataframes.

| Column   | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| image_id | `int` or `str` | Unique id of the entry. |
| identity | `int` or `str` | Identity (or label) of the depicted individual animal. |
| path     | `str` | Relative path to the image. |

There is a special value for `identity` which describes an unknown individual. Its default value for unknown animals is

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console"
from wildlife_datasets import datasets

datasets.WildlifeDataset.unknown_name
print(datasets.WildlifeDataset.unknown_name) # markdown-exec: hide
```

When a dataset contains unknown inidividuals, the identity entry should be changed to the default value described above.


## Optional columns

The following columns may be present in the dataframe. Besides these columns, it is possible to define additional columns. Where image dimensions are called for, they are given in units of pixels (rather than fraction of total image). 

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| bbox | `List[float]` | Bounding box in the form [x, y, w, h]. Therefore, the topleft corner has coordinates [x, y], while the bottomright corner has coordinates [x+w, y+h]. |
| date | special | Timestamp of the photo. The preferred format is `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` from the `datetime` package but it is sufficient to be amenable to `pd.to_datetime(x)`. |
| keypoints | `List[float]` | Keypoints coordinates in the image such as eyes or joints. |
| position | `str` | Position from which each photo was taken. The usual values are left and right. |
| segmentation | `List[float]` or special | Segmentation mask in the form [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]. Additional format are possible such as file path to a mask image, or `pytorch` RLE. |
| species | `str` or `List[str]` | The depicted species for datasets with multiple species. |
| video | `int` | The index of a video. |


## Metadata

Besides the dataframe, each dataset also contains some metadata. All entries are optional.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| licenses | License file for the dataset. |
| licenses_url | URL for the license file. |
| url | URL for the dataset. |
| cite | Citation in Google Scholar type of the paper. |
| animals | List of all animal scientific names in the dataset. |
| animals_simple | List of all animal common names in the dataset. |
| real_animals | Determines whether the images are of real animals as opposed to computer generated image. |
| year | Publication year of the dataset. |
| reported_n_total | The reported number of total animals. |
| reported_n_individuals | The reported number of individuals. |
| wild | Determines whether the environment that it was photographed in is wild. |
| clear_photos | Determines whether the database is quality-controlled such that image quality is consistent across all images. |
| pose | Determines whether the photos have one orientation (single), two orientation such as left and right flanks (double) or more (multiple). |
| unique_pattern | Determines whether the animals have unique features (fur patern, fin shape) for recognition. |
| from_video | Determines whether the dataset was created from photos or videos. |
| cropped | Determines whether the photos are cropped. |
| span | The span of the dataset (the time difference between the last and first photos). |
| size | Size of the zipped datasets (in MB). |
